# VacuumRobot
This is a simple reflex agent that cleans up randomly generated dirt in an 8x8 environment.

If you would like to work on this program more on your own, make sure you change the file paths for the images in the code on the environment class or it may not work.
This project is partially finished and working for now, however I will be making some small changes here and there to improve the agent's capabilities and make a more robust
program. The program is still very easy to break as is, I have not put any work into the stability of the program.

KNOWN BUGS

clicking on the generate map/Run AI buttons can break the program if clicked more than once.
